# Instructions for reproducing the experimental results in the work

Binary files and instances are currently in the repository. In the future, we plan to publish the source codes as well, but this requires further work on modularization to make them practically usable.

The test folder contains the following:

1. Three subfolders test/maximumBetweeness, test/metricDimension and test/romanDomination, which contain binaries for the individual problems and problem instances.
2. Scripts to run TVNS for each of these three problems: callsTVNS.maximum.betweeness.cmd, callsTVNS.metric.dimension.cmd and callsTVNS.roman.domination.
3. Excel file final.comparison.all.problems.xlsx with the results from the paper in raw and summarized form.
4. There are some other utilities and configuration files that are used for testing.
